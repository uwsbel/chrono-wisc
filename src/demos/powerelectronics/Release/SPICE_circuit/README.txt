Models = Contains all the needed file for a correct SPICE co-simulation
	- Circuit_Netlist = Contains the SPICE circuit netweork in the form of a .cir NETLIST
	- INPUT_Netlist = Contains the list of the parameters (.param par___) that SPICE receives as INPUT (NO .param ic___)
	- OUTPUT_Netlist = Contains the list of the paramters passed as OUTPUT from SPICE
	- Param_IC = Contains the list of the Initial Conditions values to assign to the ".param par" presents in the NETLIST (IMPORTANT!!! -> the list of IC needs to be listed with the same order of the ".param par" list present in the NETLIST)
	- PWL_sources = Contains the list of the PWL sources present in the NETLIST, these sources can be VARiable or PREdefined

PWL_sources = Contains a list of files containing the piece-wise trend related to the list of sources reported in Models/PWL_sources (N.B. the files in 		this folder are automatucally generated by the NETLIST_Initializer, thus at the beginning of the simulation needs to be EMPTY)

PySpice_Error_BackUp = Contains a BackUp .Json file that is saved from the "MainPython_Spice_1" modeule at every call, and is used by it in case of
			computational exception
	- PySpice_Error_BackUp = .Json file saved and used by the "MainPython_Spice_1" in case of computational exception

Results = Contains the list of folders related to the SPICE results obtained at every time-step of the simulation (N.B. the folders in this folder are 	automatucally generated by the code, thus at the beginning of the simulation needs to be EMPTY for storage safety, but the code is able to store 	the previous simulation results)
